“We shall not cease from exploration

And the end of all our exploring

Will be to arrive where we started

And know the place for the first time.”

T.S. Eliot


The point of this application is simple: to create a Platonically perfect distraction-free writer’s environment. 

Being online when you write means you’re distracted in countless ways. 

Being offline when you write used to mean you have to use outdated modes of writing, without such basic features like: copy/cut/paste, undo/redo, italics/bold. 

So this is what I set out to fix with this application. (Actually, this is what I actually got, my initial idea was to create a version of SolarWriter without some bugs I’ve encountered). 

I’m not really a coder by calling, I merely had spent about 8 years toiling at some mid-level outsource jobs, my main calling being a poet, one who changes the reality defined by the language we use, which is a different kind of ‘coding’ as well. 

The code itself was written by ChatGPT 4.0o. You can trace the logic behind me arranging the process, but I myself do not remember much from that, with the exception of the way I’ve experienced the choices made by the people who designed Swift (which I hadn’t even written ‘Hello Wor(l)d’ in before staring my work on this app) to be exhaliratingly aesthetically pleasing. My attempt to rewrite the App in Kotlin was an absolutely frustrating failure. If anyone is capabable of porting this App to Android, it’s definitely not me. But if anyone is able to, please go ahead. 

Ever since I’ve written the app I was trying to find a proper way to earn just a bit of money that could sustain me after I’ve lost my outsourcing job having developed it, while not becoming an internet mogul, someone I really have no intention of being. A couple of days ago my very good euro-friend Paul Terras, who had developed a Strong Dome technology, which he trusts will help set up the wave of building the _most modern_ and __most archaic__ homes for the TechnoShamans of the present and future, shared his own frustration with a similar problem. (I’m a reader of many books, while he says that Tao Te Ching, a bilingual version, is quite enough for him now). 

He said that the only ‘way out’ of this capitalistic creator’s nightmare he sees is to just totally outsource his work. So this is what I’m going to do. I’ve not yet submitted this app for the proper beta review. You can test it for yourself, look at the logic behind it, port it into any language, adapt it to your purpose etc. — and sumbit your version into AppStore, of course. 

My dream would be to have this app integreated with X’s Grok somehow, which I’ve found lately to be so much superior to ChatGPT in deaing with metaphysics, Kabbalah, Yeats’ Vision, Ulysses, Shakespeare’s ‘system’ (Ted Hughes), Eliot’s Four Quartets etc., that are important to my poetic avatar.  

The burden of the creator, of someone who bears the seeds of the future in his/her frail body (which in my case went through immense stress lately) but hasn’t found a proper way for planting those seeds, is not insignificant, trust me. 

(Not that I’m unique in this in any way, same thing can be said, for example, about Francis Ford Coppola, throwing his all into Megalopolis, the greatest film in the history of this dying medium, only for it to land with a thud, the way Ulysses would, I imagine, land in a comic book store). 

Hopefully a way for helping me with physical sustenance can be arranged. I’m not sure how much of software I have left in me, but surely I have many novels, poems, movies, plays, romances etc. wringling through my body, don’t think I’m allowed to ‘retire’ before these are shared with ‘The World’.

P.S. My Father was born in Dnipro, Ukraine, so obviously I couldn’t stay in Russia after the full-scale invasion had started. On the other hand, most of my roots are in Russia, so I didn’t see (maybe mistakingly?) any option of moving to Europe either. Really would prefer not to share any kind of space with the Navalini the Nazi’s followers. 

My only politics is peace, redemption and forgiveness. 

‘Won’t forgive, won’t forget’ is as brief a creed of The Church of Satan on Earth as I’ve heard of.

P.P.S. I totally forgot to mention how the app works. You create an iCloud text on iPhone, connect a BlueTooth keyboard to it, and use your Kindle's (or other ebook's -- havent's tested yet, so don't know) WebBrowser to open the IP of the iPhone. 

The Browser and iPhone communicate through WebSocket, there's a bunch of diff calculations that update the HTML content so that every change of the text on iPhone is displayed on Kindle. 

Touchscreen capabilities of Kindle are used for moving the cursor around, for selecting the section of the text, for copying and pasting, for making text italic/bold. 

There was once support for autocorrection / autocompletion, but I've turned it off because my iPhone 13 kept overheating. You can turn it on at your own risk. Also, I believe it's possible to add a touchscreen button that would have the app use iPhone's dictation capabilities, but I haven't figured that out. I'm not very good at techical specifics here, this was my second App in Swift, I believe, I don't think I would pass a Juniour Interview in it. Still, not bad for five days of software delirium, a bit more productive than an average 'software slave' at 2300 Euros a month, would you agree? 

If you have any propositions for gainful employment which would not distract me from writing fiction/screenplays/studying languages/learning about D&D 5th edtion too much, please contact me at nikolay.nikiforov@gmail.com.
